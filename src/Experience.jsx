						TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript,
						one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type
						definitions.
						<br />
						<br />
						Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing
						better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your
						code is working correctly.
						<br />
						<br />
						Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference
						allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.
